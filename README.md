# hhkb-keymap

This is my layout, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

## Principles
Basically, I want the function key to be a little bit more ergonomic, so I mapped it to the bottom right shift, since I rarely ever use that key to begin with.

I also need it to support multiple layouts (since I work in both Mac and PC), so I have T0 as a quick toggle to remap they keyboard so that it is more convenient to use on Mac. T0 is a Windows oriented layout, while T2 is a Mac oriented layout. To access it, press `RSHFIT+FN`, or to more accurately match this current layout, `L1+F20`. To go back, just repeat that key combination again. It's a quick toggle between them!

Insert and Delete were in pretty awkward positions, so those were moved. closer to the backspace key, which is also delete now.

I'm sure as we all know, stock HHKB arrows are awful as well, so they're remapped to ESDF. This is better than WASD, since you don't have to rotate your hand (although for some of you it may be instinct already at this point). Home and End are also right next to it, which makes it really convenient for editing text.

The bottom right alt keys are just there for shits and giggles, and don't really do anything.

There are volume and media controls really close to the right of the keyboard. This is done so that you don't have to move your wrist all that much to be able to hit the rest of it.

## How to Modify

Go ahead and head over to: http://www.tmk-kbd.com/tmk_keyboard/editor/unimap/?hhkb_rn42.

From there, scroll down to **Base Firmware File**. Then, insert my `HHKB Keymap Bluetooth.hex` file, and press **Load Keymap from firmware**. 

After that, you should be able to modify it!
